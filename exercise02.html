<p>Hello, World! My name is Madison Wagner and I am in my last semester of the School Library Media Program to earn my MLIS. I am currently student teaching in an elementary school and my middle school placement with be later this fall. Prior to student teaching, I worked as a library aide in an elementary school and a youth services associate in a public library. I took AP Computer Science in high school, worked with MATLAB in a research lab in undergrad, and dabbled with coding in my cataloging course through Dominican. While I donâ€™t remember specific details about coding, I understand the concept of telling the computer which steps to take (exactly!) to get the desired outcome. I am hoping to be able to manage any library website that may come my way, whether I work in a school or public library. Nice to meet you all!</p>
